            <p>There is no better feeling than having a fresh set of nails. It makes us feel confident, cute, and ready to take on the world. But it can certainly be a pretty penny to go to a salon or a nail technician every couple of weeks to maintain your nails. Not to mention the damage that can occur with certain types of manicures, like acrylics.</p>
            
            <h2>What is gel?</h2>
                <p>Gel nail polish is a thick, glossy, chip resistant nail polish that uses a UV or LED light to cure. It lasts 2-3 weeks and needs to be soaked off with acetone. It causes less damage than acrylic and there is no need to add an extension, as you paint it directly on your natural nail. Because it needs to be cured, it dries in a matter of minutes and keeps its sheen, unlike a regular nail polish manicure. No more smudged and chipped nails. It’s the perfect medium!</p>
            <h2>Why should you do it yourself?</h2>
                <p>Depending on the prices of your local salons or nail technicians, as well as the complexity of the design you choose, gel manicures can cost anywhere from $30-$70 to get done professionally, usually with an additional removal fee of $10-$20, if needed. That could mean spending up to $180 a month on your gel nails. At home starter kits range from $30-$150, but it’s pretty much a one-time cost. Of course, you’ll need to re purchase products as you run out, but the tools only need to be purchased once and your products can last many manicures. Although there might be a small learning curve, once you get the hang of doing your own gel manicure, you can save so much money and you still get to have beautiful nails.</p>
